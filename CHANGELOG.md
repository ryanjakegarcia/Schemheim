## 0.1.0

- Verify the loaded world against the blueprint: tint wrong pieces red, wrong rotations orange, and player-built pieces inside the blueprint that it does not contain magenta. Pieces that share an origin by design are matched individually. Counts appear in the Build tab; the `Verify overlay` toggle hides the tints.
- Name the hologram piece under the crosshair in the HUD, with its state and layer, whether or not a hammer is equipped.
- Add `Restrict placement`, off by default: inside the blueprint the hammer only places a piece where the blueprint wants that piece, and says what it wants instead.
- Hammer assistance skips spots occupied by a wrong piece or rotation and explains why.
- Fork [Buildheim](https://github.com/AugusDogus/Buildheim) 1.2.1 as Schemheim. New plugin GUID `fenari.Schemheim`, config file `fenari.Schemheim.cfg`, and data folder `BepInEx/config/Schemheim`.
- Reuse existing Buildheim or PlanBuild data folders and copy `augusdogus.Buildheim.cfg` or `marcopogo.PlanBuild.cfg` settings on first launch, newest first.
- Mark Buildheim and PlanBuild as incompatible so only one hammer-assist mod hooks placement.
- Preserve blueprint snap points and add a Build-tab action to align a blueprint with an aimed building snap point. (Unreleased Buildheim change carried over.)

## Buildheim history

Versions below are Buildheim releases by AugusDogus that Schemheim inherits.

## 1.2.1

- Restore ordinary hammer use when the blueprint is out of range or all pieces in the active layers are built.
- Show why hammer assistance is paused in the build HUD and planner.
- Respect disabled placement costs in hammer assistance and autobuild, including recipe, material and crafting-station requirements.

## 1.2.0

- Hide build status when no blueprint piece is targeted or the hammer is put away, and keep active status clear of the stamina bar.
- Show the hovered blueprint's name, icon and materials in Valheim's native info card, including shortage colors and the crafting-station indicator.
- Identify and highlight scenery, scaled imports and out-of-reach holograms before reporting why they cannot be built with the hammer.
- Return to ordinary Repair when no blueprint piece is targeted; blocked blueprint clicks cannot repair other structures behind the hologram.
- Keep the build HUD compact, show positioning shortcuts only while adjusting, and avoid Valheim's piece name and material costs.
- Keep locked recipes highlighted in the hologram and name the undiscovered materials, distinguishing them from hammer selection failures.
- Measure hammer reach to the aimed and supporting surfaces instead of the piece origin, including overhead pieces.
- Use Valheim's own hammer preview for the selected piece, avoiding overlapping renders and keeping its name in placement feedback.
- Pick click-to-build targets from visible mesh geometry instead of the empty space inside a whole-piece bounding box.
- Keep the next autobuild target visible between attempts, recheck its materials and selected layer, and prevent clicks from using a stale hammer recipe.

## 1.1.0

- Add an Open folder button to the Blueprints tab for the configured blueprint directory.

## 1.0.1

- Fix Thunderstore banner and screenshot links using public GitHub images pinned to the release tag.

## 1.0.0

- Prepare the first public Buildheim release with client-only blueprints, saved holograms, material checklists, and hammer autobuild.
- Add a consistent repository layout, matching package artwork, and validated release packages.
- Publish version tags to GitHub Releases and Thunderstore with the AI Generated category.

## 0.20.4

- Rotate blueprints on the normal hammer's 22.5-degree grid, with 90-degree turns while holding Shift. Preserve old placements until explicitly rotated.

## 0.20.3

- Replace radius capture with a dedicated Capture tab, two world-space corners and a visible selection box.
- Pick corners with left/right click, switch with middle click, and adjust them using modifier keys and the mouse wheel.
- Preview dimensions and piece count before saving. Capture uses corner A as its origin and preserves existing blueprint files.
- Suspend hammer assistance and consume combat/build clicks while selecting an area.
- Slide the planner in and out with Valheim inventory timing and reuse the inventory's opening and closing sounds.

## 0.20.2

- Enable or disable the current placement with F7 or the Build tab. Disabled placements hide their hologram and HUD and release hammer and positioning controls.
- Preserve disabled placements across reconnects, including their alignment, layers and material checklist. Disabling turns autobuild off.
- Show or hide Buildheim's HUD independently with F8 or the planner's header button. Remember the preference across restarts.

## 0.20.1 (Buildheim)

- Rename the mod, package, DLL and planner to Buildheim.
- Give Buildheim its own plugin ID and settings file; copy earlier client settings without overwriting existing Buildheim settings.
- Reuse existing blueprint and placement folders on upgrade. Fresh installs use the Buildheim data folder.
- Prevent loading Buildheim alongside the original PlanBuild plugin.

## 0.20.0

- Use Valheim wood panels, fonts and controls with Build, Blueprints and Materials tabs.
- Show the selected build mode and explain Preview only, Click to build and Autobuild.
- Position holograms using modifier keys and the mouse wheel, with on-screen shortcut hints.
- Find real placement surfaces around the selected blueprint piece independently of camera aim.
- Explain placement restrictions in the HUD.
- Show remaining material costs, inventory counts, observed chest contents and bulk gathering checkmarks.
- Save blueprint copies, alignment, selected layers and gathering notes per character and world. Restore with autobuild off.

## 0.19.0 (client refactor)

- Add adjustable height layers shared by hologram rendering and both hammer modes.
- Add opt-in autobuild with paced attempts and a Home-key toggle.

- Require Jötunn 2.30.0 for its Valheim 1.0.7 compatibility fixes.
- Replace server-backed plan objects and tools with local blueprint capture and mesh-only holograms.
- Add hammer assistance with automatic recipe selection, exact alignment and an inventory material check.
- Hide completed pieces in the local guide.
- Allow clients to connect without PlanBuild on the server.
- Remove runtime HookGenPatcher and custom asset requirements.
- Keep installed game files unchanged during builds.
